# Health Insurance cost prediction using Linear-Regression-

INTRODUCTION
We all know that the healthcare can be very costly and to decrease those burdens we have Health Insurance in market. Now there can be many different types of health insurance but their premium or charge is estimated based on many different factors so understanding which factors contribute to increases in health expenditures may provide insight into risk factors and potential starting points for preventive measures.
We have many studies suggesting that prediction of healthcare charges can be determined using either a regression problem or a classification problem. Previous studies also examined a broad variety of features. The most commonly used features include different sets of demographic features, health care utilization parameters, drug codes, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, various chronic disease scores and cost features.


UNDERSTANDING THE DATA
In this study our objective is to predict the health charges based on important features like:
•	Age
•	Sex
•	BMI (Body Mass Index)
•	Children (Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents)
•	Smoker
•	Region
•	Charges
For this analysis we used binary classification task, correlating each features with charges in order to capture different patterns of the data. Based on their characteristics, we built a Linear Regression Model. Finally, we tried out some tests to examine the prediction which showed us good results.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
•	Which factors affect the amount of Health Insurance?
•	How precisely the company or the customer will be able to estimate the amount of insurance?


EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a term for certain kinds of initial analysis and findings done with data sets, usually early on in an analytical process. Some experts describe it as “taking a peek” at the data to understand more about what it represents and how to apply it. It is often a precursor to other kinds of work with statistics and data.
